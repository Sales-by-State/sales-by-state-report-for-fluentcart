See a yearly breakdown of FluentCart sales by state / county / province for a given country, filterable by order status.

== Description ==

Sales by State Report for FluentCart adds a report showing net and gross sales grouped by state, county or province, for a chosen year and a chosen set of order statuses.

It appears under **FluentCart → Sales by State**.

It answers the question sales tax and territory planning actually ask: how much did each state buy in a given year, counting only the orders that matter.

This plugin requires [FluentCart](https://fluentcart.com/).

Documentation: [salesbystate.com](https://salesbystate.com/)

= What the report shows =

* Net Sales and Gross Sales for every state in the selected country
* A summary of both figures across all states
* Sortable columns and paginated results
* States with no sales, shown as zero rather than hidden

= Filters =

* **Country** — any country FluentCart defines states or provinces for. Defaults to the store's base country.
* **Year** — a rolling list that starts ten years back and gains a year each January without dropping one. Defaults to the current year.
* **Order status** — a checkbox list of FluentCart order statuses. Defaults to Completed.

= How the figures are calculated =

Gross Sales is the order total. Net Sales is the order total minus tax and shipping. Both use the values FluentCart stores on the order (converted from cents).

Refunds are not modelled as separate records. An order that has been fully refunded is controlled by the status filter. A partial refund is not deducted from its order's total.

= Performance =

Sales for a whole year are answered by one indexed query that returns one row per state. The response size does not grow with the number of orders.

= Data and privacy =

The plugin creates one custom database table holding, per order: the order ID, order status, creation and payment dates, billing and shipping country and state codes, currency, and the order, tax, shipping and net totals. It stores no names, addresses, email addresses or any other personal data.

Nothing is sent anywhere. The plugin makes no external HTTP requests, includes no third-party services, and collects no analytics or telemetry.

Deleting the plugin removes the table and its options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/sales-by-state-report-for-fluentcart`, or install it through the Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin. FluentCart must already be installed and active.
3. Go to **FluentCart → Sales by State**.

On a store that already has orders, those orders are read into the report table once. This starts on its own. If it has not finished when you open the report, a progress bar shows how far along it is.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The report shows zeros but I have orders. =

Your existing orders are still being read into the report table. Open the report and the progress bar will show how far along it is. It continues on its own; you can leave the page.

If only Completed is selected, tick any other statuses that should count.

= Which address does it group by? =

The shipping address, falling back to the billing address for orders that have no shipping address, such as digital-only orders.

= Are refunds deducted? =

The status filter decides whether an order counts. Partial refunds are not deducted from the order's total.

= Which date does the year filter use? =

The date the order was completed, falling back to the date it was created for orders that were never completed.

= Can I change the default order status? =

Yes, with the `sbsfc_default_statuses` filter.

= Where can I get support? =
